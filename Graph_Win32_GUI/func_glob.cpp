 * This project is intended to serve as a first step in the design and codification of a GUI to be used with a
 * microcontroller, typically STM32.
 * The codification of the microcontroller is preferentially made with C, instead of C++. This is because this project
 * uses .c files.
 * In order to facilitate the compatiblity between Visual Studio and microcontrollers IDE and to avoid renaming every
 * .cpp file into .c file, this trick has been used, although it is not recomendable to include source files inside another 
 * source file
